//: ## Variables Exercises
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
### Exercise 1

For each of the following names and types, create a variables or constant that best represents it:

- boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius (Double)
- gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
- naturalLogarithmicBase (Double)
- ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
- studentNickname (String)
*/
let boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius = 30.9
var gallonsRemainingInTank = 20.1
let naturalLogarithmicBase = 2.2
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 2
var studentNickname = "boris"
//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
var favoriteLanguage: Character = "S"
gallonsRemainingInTank = 20.2
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let _numberOfGasIcons: Double = gallonsRemainingInTank
var numberOfPolygonsInModel = 30
numberOfPolygonsInModel = 32
let polygonsLeftToDraw = 0
var polygonsLeftToDraw = numberOfPolygonsInModel

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to invalid names:
var nmeOfSchool = "Udacity"
var dlass = "Math"
let dmport = "Nissian"
var dmyDog = "ha"
var dyourDog = "la"
