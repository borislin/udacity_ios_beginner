struct EmployeeData {
    var baseSalary: Double
    var raisesGiven: Int
}

//: ### Exercise 1
//: Define a function called `increasePay` that takes 1 `EmployeeData` parameter called `employeeData` and 1 `Double` parameter called `percentRaise`. **`employeeData` should be a inout parameter**. The function should **add** to its `baseSalary` property by a value of `baseSalary * percentRaise` and increase the `raisesGiven` property by 1.
