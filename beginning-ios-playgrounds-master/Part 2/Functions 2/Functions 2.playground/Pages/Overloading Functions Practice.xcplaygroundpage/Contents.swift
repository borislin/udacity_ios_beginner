//: ### Exercise 1
//: Define a function called `volume` that takes 1 `Double` parameter called `side`. The function should return a `Double` that is the volume of a cube which is `side * side * side`.
//: **The solution is available on the next page!**

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Define a function called `volume` that takes 2 `Double` parameters: `radius` and `height`. The function should return a `Double` that is the volume of a cylinder which is roughly `3.14 * r * r * h`.
//: **The solution is available on the next page!**

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Define a function called `volume` that takes 3 `Double` parameters: `length`, `height`, and `width`. The function should return a `Double` that is the volume of a cuboid which is `length * height * width`.
//: **The solution is available on the next page!**
