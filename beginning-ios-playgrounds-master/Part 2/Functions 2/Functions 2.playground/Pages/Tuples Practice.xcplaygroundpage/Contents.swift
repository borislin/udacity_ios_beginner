## Tuples Practice
*/
//: ### Exercise 1
//: Define a function called `basicOperations` that takes 2 `Double` parameters: `x` and `y`. The function should return a tuple of type `(Double, Double, Double, Double)` that contains resulting values for each of the four basic mathematical operations in this order: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each operation should be applied as `x [operator] y`. **Using zero may result in a crash!**.
