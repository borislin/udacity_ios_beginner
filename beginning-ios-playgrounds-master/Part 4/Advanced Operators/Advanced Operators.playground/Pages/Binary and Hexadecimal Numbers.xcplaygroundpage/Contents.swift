## Binary and Hexadecimal Numbers
It is not often that we as Swift developers need to use binary or hexadecimal numbers, but they are a core concept you may see from time to time. If you would like to read up about binary and hexadecimal numbers, check out this [Math is Fun article](http://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html).

Note: The type `UInt8` (seen below) can represent positive integers from 0 to 255. We use `UInt8` here to keep the numbers small.
