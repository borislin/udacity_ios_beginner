// Because this call to the eatCake func operators on a CakeHaverStruct (value type) it modifies a copy.
var valueType = CakeHaverStruct()

// But in this example eatCake is called on a CakeHaverClass (reference type) and it directly modifies the object.
var referenceType = CakeHaverClass()
eatCake(referenceType)
cakeStatus(referenceType) // Prints "No more cake"
